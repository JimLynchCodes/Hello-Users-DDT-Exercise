# Hello-Users-DDT-Exercise

A "Development-Driven Testing" Exercise!

<br/>
<br/>

_Here's the situation..._

<br/>
<br/>

Your boss gives you this codebase and says we are inheriting it.

No one from the original team is still here, but they told us not to worry, there's some great unit tests here...


<br/>
<br/>

Your job is to:

- Make sure it works

- Make sure it has "clean code"

- Make sure it has "good tests"

<br/>
<br/>


Good luck!

<br/>
